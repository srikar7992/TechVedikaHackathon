Given integer N as input, you have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (excluding the number itself). 
A positive proper divisor divides a number without leaving any remainder.

Problem Constraints
-------------------
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 106

Input Format
------------
-> The first line of the input contains a single integer T.
-> Each of the next T lines contains a single integer N.

Output Format
-------------
In a separate line, print YES if a given integer is perfect, else print NO.

Example Input
-------------
1) 4
2) 6
3) 3

Example Output
--------------
1) NO
2) YES
3) NO

Example Explanation
-------------------
 For A = 4, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4. 
 For A = 6, the answer is "YES" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6. 
 For A = 3, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1, is not equal to 3.
